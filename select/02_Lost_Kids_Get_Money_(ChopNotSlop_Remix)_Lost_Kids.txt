Fuck the world

Yeah, I just pulled up in this bitch
In the function with my clique
I stay in the back, big thing on my hip
Fuckin' in the back, I stay with a bitch
I just pulled up in this bitch
In the function with my clique
I just pulled up in this bitch
In the function with my clique
I just pulled up in this bitch
In the function with my clique
I just pulled up in this bitch
In the function with my clique
I stay, I stay in the back, big thing on my hip
Fuckin', fuckin' in the back, I stay with a bitch
Smellin', smellin' like a lick, smellin' like Margiela
Seein', seein' is believin', I don't see none of you fellas
Drop a song and these famous bitches love it
Drop a song and these famous bitches love it
Drop a song and these famous bitches love it
I'm a dog, they don't run from me in public
If I hit it, then it ain't worth no discussion
We the reason that our city buzzin'
All my, all my bros collect, all my bros is lit
Who need work? I could plug you with connects
Shit get hot, who you gon' collect?
Who you, who you just finessed? Go lay low out west

Money get, money get lost when you don't chase it
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankrolls
Money get lost when you don't chase it
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankrolls
Money get lost when you don't chase it
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankrolls
Money get lost when you don't chase it
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankrolls

Look at me, you ain't gettin' no bread
All my fuckin' soldiers get paid
Look at me, you ain't gettin' no bread
All my fuckin' soldiers get paid
Look at me, you ain't gettin' no bread
All my fuckin' soldiers get paid
If you, if you on the block today
They'll want, they'll want to take your guap away
Ride, ride in the Rover through my old hood with my friends
I'm still, I'm still pipin' hoes from like 2010
They heard, they heard about my moves, they know I'm the man
I got too, got too much to lose fuckin' on these fans
I paid, I paid all my dues, plus I never ran
I need all the loot, put it in my hand
I paid all my dues, plus I never ran
I need all the loot, put it in my hand
I paid all my dues, plus I never ran
I need all the loot, put it in my hand
Grab your girl 'cause I'ma fuck her
She chose up, I do it like no other, no
Anywhere I wanna, I go
Doin' all, doin' all these shows
We been spendin' all this dough

Money get, money get lost when you don't chase it
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankrolls
Money get, money get lost when you don't chase it
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankrolls
Money get, money get lost when you don't chase it
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankrolls
Money get, money get lost when you don't chase it
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankrolls

Before we get outta here, man, gotta save much
