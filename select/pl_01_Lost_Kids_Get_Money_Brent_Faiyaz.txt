Uh, yeah
I just pull up in this bitch
In the function with my clique
I stay in the back,
big thing on my hip
Fuckin' in the back,
I stay with a bitch
Smellin' like a lick,
smellin' like Margiela
Seein' is believin',
I don't see none of you fellas
(Stevie Wonder)
Dropped a song and
these famous bitches love it
I'm a dog,
they don't root for me in public
If I hit it then it ain't woth
no discussion
We the reason
that our city buzzin'
All my bros collect,
all my bros is next
Who need work?
I could plug you with connects
Shit get hot, who you call,
collect?
Who you just finesse?
Go lay low out West
Money get lost
when you don't chase it
(Go and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for?
She be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost
when you don't chase it
(Go and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for?
She be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost
when you don't chase it
(Go and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for?
She be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost
when you don't chase it
(Go and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for?
She be lookin' at bankroll
Look at me,
you ain't get no bread
(Yeah, yeah)
All my fuckin' soldiers get paid
If you on a plot today (Hey)
Don't let one-two
take your guap away
Just took a ride in the Rover
through my old hood
with my friends
I'm still pipin' hoes from
like 2010
They heard about my moves,
they know I'm the man
I got too much to lose,
fuckin' on these fans
I paid all my dues,
plus I never ran
I need all the loot put it
in my hand, uh
Better grab your girl
'cause I'ma fuck her
She chose up,
I do it like no other, no
Anywhere I wanna go,
I been doin' all these shows
I be spendin' all this dough
Money get lost
when you don't chase it
(Go and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for?
She be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost
when you don't chase it
(Go and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for?
She be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost
when you don't chase it
(Go and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for?
She be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost
when you don't chase it
(Go and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for?
She be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost
when you don't chase it
